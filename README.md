#Android IRC (better name to come)#

This is the home of a future IRC client based on the jerklib libray. 
The source and documentation for the library can be found [here](http://jerklib.sourceforge.net/).
I am hoping to consistently work on this project for the next few months while school
is letting me. Hopefully I can finish this project by the end of the summer. The application 
will be free and open source so if you stumbled upon this project somehow and would like to 
make improvements (I am sure there will be a few) go ahead and clone the repo.

##Installation:##

Once you have cloned the repo, simply open the project in Eclipse through the standard importing
procedure.
